# Matlab

This is a practical example of how I used MATLAB in approximately 2013. This code is absolutely horrible and contains only one function (!) because I was not aware of basic CS concepts at the time.

I posted this code because, although it's horrible, it does work properly. The assignment was to design a chemical plant, not write beautiful code, so I got my team a good grade with the results it produced. We were the only team to develop our own code to design our plant.

This code is a reminder of how far I've come as a developer. The nights I stayed up working on it helped me realize programming is a true passion of mine and that I had a lot to learn if I wanted to make a career of it.
